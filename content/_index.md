## Abstract

- Programming is becoming a central activity in research, far beyond the realm of computer science. 

- Mainstream programming languages are flourishing around well-identifiable communities and well-established programming platform. 

- For instance, 
    + Python is the language of Data Science, 
    + JavaScript targets the Web, and 
    + the JVM is often the primary choice among multi-agent systems, logic-based technologies, as well as backend and mobile development. 

- Along this line, in order to maximize the reach of research-oriented software, it is of paramount importance to write code supporting as much platforms (and languages) as possible. 

- Of course, maintaining multiple codebases is a no-go, and this is why researchers often focus on particular platformsâ€”hence limiting their potential audience. 

- Accordingly, in this course we present approaches and best-practices for multi-platform programming, where the same codebase is made available on multiple platforms, minimizing rewriting of code while maximizing portability.
